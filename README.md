## Installation:
In order to access the files needed to complete the challenge see: https://github.com/CorySillaots/build-a-team and clone either the following HTTPS link or SSH key:
HTTPS Link: https://github.com/CorySillaots/build-a-team.git
SSH Key: git@github.com:CorySillaots/build-a-team.git
In order to clone the project to a "projects" directory, open your terminal (mac) or gitbash (windows) window and type the following commands into your terminal/gitbash command line:
1 - mkdir projects
2 - cd ./projects (You can use the command "pwd" to ensure you are in the correct directory)
3 - git clone <HTTPS link> OR git clone <SSH Key>
4 - ls (this will list all of the files now inside of the current directory)

Open your coding software, select "open file" and locate the module-10-challenge file in your projects directory OR find the correct file in your directory and "Open With" your coding software.

## Usage
- The purpose of the Build-a-Team is to take user input from a command line application and generate an HTML file.
- The application should prompt a user for Manager name, ID, email and office number.
- The application should prompt a user for an Engineer name, ID, email and Github user name.
- The application should prompt a user for an Intern name, ID and school name.
- Each role will have different CSS classes in the final HTML file.

# Sample HTML file can be found in the project repository under dist/index.html
